        Generate questions with these requirements:

        - There should be exactly {num_questions} questions with exactly {scq_count} Single Choice Questions (SCQ) and {mcq_count} Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ).
        - For each question, provide exactly 4 answer options labeled a., b., c., and d. Ensure all options are unique and plausible.
        - Never include "all of the above" as a possible option.
        - Each option should begin with a letter followed by a period and a space (e.g., "a. king").
        - Each question must test a different concept.
        - Each question should also mention the type of question it is. There are only two types: SCQ and MCQ.
        - A SCQ (single choice question) must have only one right option.
        - A MCQ (multiple choice question) must have at least two right options. 
        â€“ Each question must be focussed solely on the passage. 
        - Each question should have a time, between 10 to 30 seconds, associated with answering the question, dependent on the difficulty of the question.
        - Each question should use active voice and make it more direct and natural-sounding.
        - Each question should be constructuved like "What" or "Who" or "Where" or "When" or "How" or "Why" and so on.
        â€“ Each question must be phrased conversationally and directly, avoiding awkward or overly formal constructions.
        â€“ Each question should be grammatically correct and suitable for middle to high school readers.
        - The final output must be a valid JSON array with no syntax errors, no markdown or extra description.

        Example JSON format you must strictly follow, including field names and structure:

        {{
        "Quiz": {{
            "Topic": "a sentence explaining the topic of the text. Don't include the type of question, number of points, or chapter number",
            "Questions": [
            {{
                "Question": "only the text of the question, do not mention type, number of points earned, or time to answer. If question is a MCQ, then the text "(Select all answers that are correct)" should follow the question",
                "Question_type": "Type of the question: either MCQ or SCQ",
                "Options": ["a. 1st option", "b. 2nd option", "c. 3rd option", "d. 4th option"],
                "Right_Option": "c",
                "Number_Of_Points_Earned": 10,
                "Chapter": "Just provide the chapter (ex: Chapter 2)"
                "Timer": "Include number of seconds for question (ex: 10)"
            }}
            ]
        }}
        }}
